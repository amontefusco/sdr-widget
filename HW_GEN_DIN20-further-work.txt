Reusing ADC input I2S port toward SPDIF receiver.

Clock configuration
- Needed whenever the frequency rate changes
- Identical division setting for 44.1 and 48
- Clock setup is done with pm_gc_setup(), move all occurances to a function..
  In UAC2 it is called repeatedly in uac2_usb_specific_request.c
  In UAC1 it is called once in AK5394A_task_init of taskAK5349.c




Power control in HW_GEN_DIN_20
- Quite messy with patches on one board but not the other
- IO pins accessed in taskAK5394.c
- IO pins accessed in composite_widget.c



Silencer code
- Which chunks of code try to clear the output buffers?
- Which chunks of code will mute the outgoing I2S interface?



Other notes
- AK5394A_task_init() doesn't really start a task. Is called from hpsdr_AK5394A_task_init(), uac1_AK5394A_task_init(), ..... and presumably uac2.... which does.
